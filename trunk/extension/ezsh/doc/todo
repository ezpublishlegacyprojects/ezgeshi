 . do not highlight a value when there are errors in the settings name
 . highlight extra brackets in the settings name
 . highlight ending chars in value when it has both starting and ending ones

- fix / improve parsing of tpl files
 . tpl operators after a | are ignored (they are ok if there's a whitespace in between)
 . parameter names within functions are still parsed as operators (eg. {node_view_full attribute=$x} )
 . distinguish (for links to manual) operators that are different depending on context (eg. break for strings and for foreach)
