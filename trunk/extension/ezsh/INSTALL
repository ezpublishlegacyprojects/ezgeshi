1 - activate the extension following the standard eZ Publish procedures
    (remember to regenerate the ezp_extension.php autoload file)

2 - for highlighting of source code in the Online Editor, many new styles are
    added for the "literal" tag.
    Edit the settings/content.ini.append.php file to remove unused languages
    if you find the list too long

3 - optional: grant permissions on the geshi/view_ezpublish_source or geshi/view_any_source
    functions to those roles that will be allowed to see highlighted files via
    the geshi/highlight view.
    NB: to see highlited content in rich text or via the template operator ezsh
    there is no need to set any specific permissions
    NBB: the second permisison allows highlighting of ANY file on the server !!!
         We strongly recommend using open_basedir limitation in php.ini along with it

To test access to the geshi/highlight view, use an url like the following ones:
http://ezp/index.php/my_site_admin/geshi/highlight/design/standard/templates/node/view/full.tpl
http://ezp/index.php/my_site_admin/geshi/highlight/settings/override/site.ini.append.php
